Pratik11 - Simple C# Object-Oriented Programming Example
This project demonstrates the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#. It includes a Person class and uses it to create and manipulate objects with various attributes and behaviors.

Project Overview
Person Class
The Person class represents a basic person with attributes and a method for self-introduction.

Properties:
Ad : The person's first name.
Soyad : The person's last name.
DogumTarihi : The person's year of birth.
Gorev : The person's occupation.
Method:
KendiniTanit(): This method outputs the person's name, birth year, and occupation to the console.
Usage
The project includes three instances of the Person class. Each object uses the KendiniTanit method to display its information in the console.
